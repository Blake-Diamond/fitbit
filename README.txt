##3D Personal Navigation Device

This repository is for a 3D personal navigation device that was built as part of an embedded systems course at UC Santa Barbara. The HW platform is the Nexys 4 DDR board from Digilent, on which a Microblaze is emulated on the board's FPGA.

The primary utility of this device is to perform accurate step-counting and perform waypoint calculations using pedometor based dead-reckoning techniques.
